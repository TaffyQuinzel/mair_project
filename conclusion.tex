\section{Conclusion}
Our research question was: How can or should a Turing Test be used in future Artificial Intelligence research? Philosophers and scientists have provided many objections against the Turing Test measuring actual intelligence, and we cannot rectify all those objections. Therefore, we conclude that the Turing Test is not a secure method for testing intelligence.

However, we think that the Turing Test can still be used in another domain, namely in the field of human language interaction. The Turing Test has provided a basis for discussing how human interaction works, and can be used to test whether models which produce human language are conceived as producing actual human language.
